## Problem 6 : Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

### Reasoning for choosing data structures and/or algorithms

In each visit of elements in the array, update max and min value if necessary.

### Time Complexity

- O(n) - We should visit each element of the array.

### Space Complexity

- O(1) - only `minInt` and `maxInt` variables take up new spaces, regardless of how lengthy the input array is.
